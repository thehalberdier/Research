This page summarizes findings from the health report file `healthreport_Arista.txt`.

## Snapshot

- Report timestamp: Sat Jan 31 09:41:47 UTC 2026
- Model: Arista DCS-7060CX-32S-R (HW v01.00, Mfg date 2016-04-21)
- EOS: 4.26.6M
- Uptime at capture: ~20 minutes

## Overall status

Cooling, temperatures, and flash look healthy. The report shows **PSU2 offline**, but in this test setup that was expected because PSU2 was not connected to power (so the system was running without redundancy).

## Key findings

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cooling | Pass | Fans OK and stable; ambient 25°C |
| Temperature | Pass | All sensors below alert/critical thresholds |
| Power supplies | Expected (lab setup) | PSU1 OK (~125.5W load); PSU2 shows “Power Loss Offline” when not connected |
| Modules/ASIC status | Script false-fail | `show module` is not supported on this platform, so the report’s FAIL here is not a hardware fault by itself |
| Interfaces | N/A (bench state) | All ports show `notconnect` / `Not Present` (no optics/cables); `Ma1` also down |
| Flash | Pass | `/mnt/flash` 63% used; writable |

## Details

### Power (expected in this test setup)

`show environment power` indicates:

- PSU 1: Ok, drawing input current and supplying ~125.5W
- PSU 2: **Power Loss Offline**, 0.0W (expected when not connected)

This is fine for lab testing, but it removes redundancy and increases risk if PSU1 or its feed fails.

### “Modules are not reporting Active” (likely not real)

The report section “MODULE & ASIC STATUS” runs `show module`, but the output returns:

- “Unavailable command (not supported on this hardware platform)”

So treat the report’s FAIL on that section as a limitation of the report script, not necessarily a device health issue.

## Recommended next checks

To restore redundancy, connect PSU2 to AC and confirm it transitions to `Ok`. If it still shows offline:

1. Reseat PSU2 and verify it’s the correct model for the chassis.
2. Swap AC cable/outlet/circuit (or swap PSUs between slot 1 and slot 2 if you have a safe procedure).
3. Re-run these commands and look for state changes:

```
show environment power
show logging | include PSU|Power|pwr|power-supply
show system environment cooling
show system environment temperature
```
